		Methods - where  logic is written, Data gets modified
		
	x = 5	-->	f(x) = x + 10; --> f(5) = 15
	
	
	
		return_type	name_of_method (arg) {
						
						// body
						}
		when a method doesnot return anything --> return_type is void
		
		
		
		Constructors --> 
		
		Constructor is a method which has same name as that of class
		It doesnot return anything not even null 
		It is used to initialize default variables
		
		It is called when an object is created
		If a class doesnot have a constructor, JVM will create a default constructor for that class
		
		
		OOP Concepts
		Object oriented programming concepts
		
		- Classes and Object concept (Done)
		- Encapsulation (Done)
		- Inheritance (Done)
		
		- Polymorphism
			- Over Loading 
			- Over Riding
		- Abstraction
			- Abstract Class
			- Interfaces
		
		
		
		
		Webpage -- 10 web elements -- implicit wait = 6 sec
		
		
		worst case scenario
			- Each element appearing at 6th sec  = 6 * 10 = 60
		
		Best possible scenario
		
			- All the element are already there = 0 sec (~milli seconds)
		
		
		Access Modifier and class Modifier
		
		Two ways to access variables and Methods
			- By creating an object
			- By Inheritance
		
		4 access modifiers
			- public
			- private
			
			- protected
			- default (no keyword is used)
		
		Both protected and default can be used within same package everywhere by both means
		but outside a package default variables and methods cannot be accessed at all
		and protected variables and methods can be accessed but only via inheritance
		
		//---------------------------------------------------------
		
		Final
		- variable
			- primitive
				A final primitive variable -- Value can never be changed
			- non primitive
				A final non primitive variable can never be reinitialized
				
				One can change the state of the objects
			
			
		
		- method
			-	A Final method can never be over ridden
			
		
		- Class
			- A final class can never be extended
			
			
			example: String class

		Scenario:
		Navigate to any ecomerce site
		Get the count of link
		Get url from a link
		Iterate over each link and print its linktext and URL
		
		Static keyword explanation scenario:
		
		- Create a class called Employee
			- employeeId (should be generated as an incremental value for each employee)
			- Employee Name
			- Employee Org
			
			- create a menthod to print employee info
