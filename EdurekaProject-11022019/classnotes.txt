	x = 5	-->	f(x) = x + 10; --> f(5) = 15
	
	
	
		return_type	name_of_method (arg) {
						
						// body
						}
		when a method doesnot return anything --> return_type is void
		
		
		
		Constructors --> 
		
		Constructor is a method which has same name as that of class
		It doesnot return anything not even null 
		It is used to initialize default variables
		
		It is called when an object is created
		If a class doesnot have a constructor, JVM will create a default constructor for that class
		
		
		OOP Concepts
		Object oriented programming concepts
		
		- Classes and Object concept (Done)
		- Encapsulation (Done)
		- Inheritance (Done)
		
		- Polymorphism
			- Over Loading 
			- Over Riding
		- Abstraction
			- Abstract Class
			- Interfaces
		
		
		
		
		Webpage -- 10 web elements -- implicit wait = 6 sec
		
		
		worst case scenario
			- Each element appearing at 6th sec  = 6 * 10 = 60
		
		Best possible scenario
		
			- All the element are already there = 0 sec (~milli seconds)
		
		
		Access Modifier and class Modifier
		
		Two ways to access variables and Methods
			- By creating an object
			- By Inheritance
		
		4 access modifiers
			- public
			- private
			
			- protected
			- default (no keyword is used)
		
		Both protected and default can be used within same package everywhere by both means
		but outside a package default variables and methods cannot be accessed at all
		and protected variables and methods can be accessed but only via inheritance
